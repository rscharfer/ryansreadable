# Project 2: Readable
*a part of Udacity's React Nanodegree Program*

### About this Project

This is the second project of three from Udacity's React Nanodegree program. The app allows you to make posts on under one of three categories -- Udacity, React, and Redux  -- and comment on each of those posts.  You can vote on the posts and comments and sort them according date and vote score.  Posts and comments are deletable and editable. 

While completing this project, we needed to show (among other things) that we understand : 

* Redux
* React
* JSX

[Additional requirements can be found in the project specification here.](requirements.pdf)


### The easiest way to view the app
